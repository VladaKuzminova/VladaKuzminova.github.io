	Inquisitive and dilligent artist with a generalist skillset in 3D Animation,
	specifically dynamic simulations, character animation, modeling, surfacing and lighting.
	I am always eager to learn about new tools and techniques, and take on creative challenges
	in digital and traditional media. Throughout my 4 years at Sheridan College
	I had a chance to learn about and participate in every step of the animation pipeline,
	studying alongside some of the most creative and dedicated artists I know.
	I was one of the production managers in my 3rd year group film "Overthrone",
	which was the first 3D production I was involved in. A lot of the skills 
	and technical knowledge I picked up during that time helped me to go on and
	and create my own short 3D film titled <a href="https://vimeo.com/267740933" target="_blank">"Our Demons"</a> in my last year at Sheridan.
